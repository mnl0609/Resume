<h3>Skills</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>I am skilled to do <b><i>multitasking</i></b>, thanks to my previous jobs and trainings as well which made this skill an asset.</li>
		<li>Due to varieties of people interaction and time zones, I have improved my skill to <b><i>adapt</i></b> not only with the environment I am in but also with the work I have been assigned to.</li>
		<li>It is also an asset knowing not only one language, I can speak two local languages and English, of course. Being a <b><i>multilingual</i></b> person is a benefit because not only I can express myself and communicate well with the universal language but it can become handy in many ways.</li>
		<li>Due to my previous work, empathy is the primary key for a better communication and successful interaction. With this case, I can say that there is an improvement with my connection with variety of people internationally.  Making my <b><i>Human Connection Empowerment</i></b> a success, though it is still a constant adaptation.</li>
		<li>Being in a modern environment where change is constant, it is only necessary for us to build our <b><i>body clock shifts</i></b> for us to be able to survive. It would be best for us to adapt on our surrounding and not vice versa.</li>
